Martin:

07/03 - 2008
4 hours:        Ported some of the drawing code from C.

28/03 - 2008
5 hours:        Begun to work on user interaction and
                some more on the drawing part.
29/03 - 2008
2 hours:        Changed some of the data structure and
                created the box class.
03/04 - 2008
6 hours:        Begun the dynamic box positioning algorithm.
                Opens for the possibility of having cubes
                of arbitrary size.
04/04 - 2008
7 hours:        Finished the dynamic positioning algorithm
                along with some minor changes.
07/04 - 2008
4 hours:        Begun working on the side rotation algorithm.

08/04 - 2008
5 hours:        More on side rotation and some animation.

11/04 - 2008
2 hours:        Continuing with rotation.

17/04 - 2008
1 hour:         Commented some code.

28/04 - 2008
7 hours:        Some rearranging, and fixing minor issues.
                Changed a vital part of the data structure
                which allowed for a quicker positioning
                algorithm.
29/04 - 2008
6 hours:        Same as the above. Create the setup.py
                script for easier distribution.
06/05 - 2008
9 hours:        Fixing some of the side rotation issues and
                structured the directories.
07/05 - 2008
10 hours:       Rewritten quite a bit of the rotation code to use
                quaternions. Very fun to play with, but I have
                no clue what they mean.

08/05 - 2008
12 hours:       Rotations should be complete.

09/05 - 2008
9 hours:        Finished the animation and action methods. Now the
                entire cube should be automatic. Wrote some tests
                and documentation.

Torkild:

29/03 - 2008:
3 hours:        Some looking on datastructures

29/04 - 2008:
5 hours:        Rewrote calculations of box position

05/05 - 2008:
5 hours:        Started looking on solver (cubex.cpp)

06/05 - 2008:
9 hours:        Cont. + debugging on C++ solver as SWIG extension.

07/05 - 2008:
12 hours:       Made wrapper code interface with python correctly.
            
08/05 - 2008:
12 hours:       Finished functionality on wrapper code.

09/05 - 2008:
10 hours:       Removed _all_ of the memory leaks from the wrapper code.
                Wrote some tests and documentation.
